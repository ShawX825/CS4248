      "Speaker 3: Well, Speaker 3 will tell ya Speaker 3 do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't Speaker 3.",
      "Speaker 2: Yes, it was! it was ya Speaker 3! Uh huh! Okay, it was Speaker 2!",
      "Speaker 1: How is it you?",

      "Speaker 1: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, The casting director only talks to agents.",

Estelle, no, Speaker 2 don't know what Speaker 2 is going to do with Speaker 2. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",
      "Speaker 3: Is anybody else scared?",
      "Speaker 2: 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. Speaker 2 don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see a doll?' Speaker 2 need a pen.",
